\subsection{Key Scientific Observations}

\paragraph{Overall Performance Characteristics} 
Across all benchmark scenarios with a total of 28,604 packets, the Î¼DCN architecture demonstrated consistent performance with an average RTT of 5.30 ms. The 95th percentile latency of 8.00 ms indicates good tail performance, which is critical for interactive applications. These results validate the architecture's suitability for content-centric networking applications in both stable and variable network conditions.
